Stands for "Super User Do"

Used to run commands with higher privileges

Regular users can use this for temporary access.

Only regular users in the _sudoers_ file have access to the sudo command.

It is possible to become _root_ as needed with the _sudo su -_ command. Not great for security purposes, but it is possible.
