Lists live in brackets. [   ]

Indices begin with 0, not 1.

List slicing uses colons to pick out what you want. The number after the colon is not included (ex: list[1:3])

Index = -1 will grab the last element in a list

Append with the ._append_ method.

Delete with the _.pop_ method (last item only)

Delete specific entry in list with _.pop(IND)_ (and IND)
