| ifconfig                | Shows your interface types, and the associated IP address, netmask, broadcast address, and the MAC address                 |
| iwconfig                | Shows your wireless interface connections                                                                                  |
| ping                    | Sends packets of data to  addresses, to see if a connection is possible.                                                   |
| arp [-a]                | Shows ip addresses it talks to, and the associated MAC address                                                             |

| ip                      | ifconfig is getting derecated, so ip is the "new" tool. [a] acts like ifconfig, [n] acts like arp, and [r] acts like route |
